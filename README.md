# vim-for-cs2xx
A starter Vim configuration for UIC's 200-level CS courses

## What Is This?
This starter pack is designed to turn your personal Vim into a pleasant programming environment for the C, C++, x86, and y86 assignments of the 200-level CS courses at UIC (211 Programming Practicum, 251 Data Structures, and 261 Machine Organization 1).

## Why Do I Want This?
Good question! By installing this easy starter pack, you could have:
* Pretty colors!
* Tab completion of code!
* Automatic error checking!
* Convenient keybindings!
* Educational annotations!
* Did I mention the pretty colors?

What's more, it's fully tested and guaranteed to work with the ~~archaic~~ well-tested version of Vim installed on Bertvm and Ernievm.

## Installation

First, make sure you're connected to **Bertvm** or **Ernievm**. This configuration only partially works with the 12-year-old (!!) version of Vim installed on Bert and Ernie, and **is not supported anywhere else**. Sorry folks, for your home setup, you're on your own.

In an appropriate directory (~/Documents is fine), run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wilt00/vim-for-cs2xx.git
cd vim-for-cs2xx
chmod +x install.rb
./install.rb
```

## Bugs
If you find any bugs, open an issue [here](https://github.com/wilt00/vim-for-cs2xx/issues). You'll need a GitHub account, but you should have one anyway.
